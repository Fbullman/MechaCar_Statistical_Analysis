## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
We will need some representative data we could use to performe comparison with competitors.

Cost of individual components in the supply chain,

Fuel efficiency: Data on MPG results, distance traveled, etc...

Engine Horse Power: Engine sizes per model types, fuel types, body frame sizes and weights, etc...

Safety rating: colision data, level of damage, cost of repairs.
